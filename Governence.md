# Governance for the WeAll Repository

This repository is maintained by **Errol Jacob Jones Swaby** until the **Architects of Regenerative Sovereignty (A.R.S.)** nonprofit is formally established.  

Decisions are made according to the following principles:
- **Transparency:** All significant discussions occur in public channels (GitHub issues, PRs).
- **Consensus:** Pull requests are merged when there is clear consensus from maintainers.
- **Future Transition:** Governance of this repo will transition to A.R.S. once established.
